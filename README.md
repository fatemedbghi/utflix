Implementing virtual movie streaming service similar to Netflix based on client-server
model with a recommendation system. Web server was based on AP HTTP::server. HTML was used as a markup
language for implementing user interface.
**AP HTTP::_server_** is a simple web application server-side blocking framework for C++ based on simplified versions of [W++](http://konteck.github.io/wpp/), [HappyHTTP](http://scumways.com/happyhttp/happyhttp.html), and [cpp-netlib](http://cpp-netlib.org/).
